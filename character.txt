We need to do that first part, work on stuff.

So I'm going to do a quick demo.

I made this folder, my first novel.

I'm pretending I'm writing a novel.

We have a git repository in here as we did it.

We initialized it earlier.

So I'm now pretending to sit down day one of writing my novel and I'm going to do some work.
